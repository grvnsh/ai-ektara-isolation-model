# Ektara Detector

This Python script implements an artificial neural network model for detecting the presence of an ektara in audio recordings. It leverages spectrograms as input features and employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for classification. The model includes functions for loading audio, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

# Key Features:

* Audio loading and preprocessing using Librosa
* Spectrogram generation for feature extraction
* CNN-based ektara detection model
* Model training and evaluation metrics
* Potential for ektara isolation (not implemented)

# Further Development

* Data Augmentation
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Advanced Model Architectures to Optimize Performance
